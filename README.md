# About This Project

I created this project to begin playing with GraphQL. The full tutorial can be found here: https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/ 

In this tutorial, I learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack I used was based on Node.js, graphql-yoga and Prisma.

Graphql-yoga is a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of Express.js. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playgrounds and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers of the GraphQL server are implemented using the Prisma client thatâ€™s responsible for database access.
